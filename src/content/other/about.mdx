My name is Hyunsun Chung. I also go by Horace in the English speaking part of the world. Welcome to my obligatory "corner of the internet". 

I'm working to be a well-rounded computer systems engineer in all regards, from operating systems to storage.

With that said, I'm not much of a web design guru, so you'll have to make do with a [template](https://github.com/louisescher/spectre) I found lying around.

Anyways, enjoy your time here with the little stuff I've got here.
