Anime and Manga has always stuck around in my long list of hobbies, no matter what has changed around me.

From the latest seasonals to the niche slice of life or psychological anime and mangas, I'll always take an interest into what's going on.

My favorite genre of anime and manga are slice of life shows, with a particular focus in iyashikei (healing) and CGDCT (Cute Girls Doing Cute Things). Two of my favorite shows are the ARIA series and K-ON.
