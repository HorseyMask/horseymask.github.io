Caffeine is the world's most widely consumed psychoactive drug (apparently), to keep us awake during boring meetings.

With this, I asked myself: "How can I consume caffeine in the most delicious way possible?"

And so, I fell into the deep rabbit hole of coffee, leading to an (unhealthy amount of) interest into espresso and filter coffee.
