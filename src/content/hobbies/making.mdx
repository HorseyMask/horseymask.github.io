"Making" is a vague term, but it's what I got from the phrase "makerspace", or a public place for people to work on physical projects.

While being a software guy by trade, I'm not afraid of getting my hands (too) dirty for physical hardware projects. After all, system engineers need some level of hardware expertise, right?

From making modifications to existing things, to 3D printing and finally soldering simple electrical projects, I'm always in the business in tinkering to create something new or make an existing thing even better.
