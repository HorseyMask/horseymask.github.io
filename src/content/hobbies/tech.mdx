While I am in the business of computers and whatnot, it's still fun to be more interested in all things tech.

From consumer electronics reviews to just the state of the industry, everything is fair game.

Some of these areas include PC hardware, custom keyboards, audiophile headphones, gaming handhelds, and much more.

A new angle into tech that I'm also interested in is homelabbing, or running servers at home to self-host services that I want.
