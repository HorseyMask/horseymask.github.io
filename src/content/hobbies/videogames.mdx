Aside from anime and manga, video games is another form of entertainment I turn to on a regular basis.

From the triple A games and first party Nintendo games to popular indies and retro games, I'm open to trying out a variety of genres of games as well. Just not games that are difficult for the sake of being difficult (I'm looking at you, Mario Kaizos).

Some standout genres are FPS, platformers, and metroidvanias for me, with Team Fortress 2 being my all time favorite video game.
